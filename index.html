                        <p>10/2013 - 10/2014 &nbsp; Software Development Intern</p>
                        <p>Scottsdale, AZ office &nbsp; supervisor: Dirk Matthews</p>
                        <p>The Job: I was part of a SCRUM team, as their development intern. I worked with code, with SAPUI5, and later in Fiori. I worked with the QA (Qualtiy Assurance) department in testing and the KM (Knowledge Management) in documentation. I gained professional experience with the SAPUI5 language (now open source) which is based on Javascript/bootstrap/jQuery. I became familiarized with Google Chrome developer's tools. I contributed to team projects, and my code was included in final products.</p>

                        <p>The Job: I was responsible for assisting interested parties in deciding whether or not college was for them, help them find out how to finance school, and help them find the right program for what their goals were. I specialized in IT degrees, enrolling from Associates through Masters programs based in the field (requiring extensive knowledge of job expectations within IT). I also specialized in assisting military personal, veterans, and their families.</p>
